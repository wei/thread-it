## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Git
- A Discord bot token for testing
- A test Discord server

### Step 1: Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/thread-it.git
   cd thread-it
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your test bot token
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-thread-archiving`
- `bugfix/permission-validation`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`

## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Style

- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- **Use type hints** where appropriate
- **Add docstrings** to all functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and single-purpose
- **Use meaningful** variable and function names

### Example Code Style

```python
async def create_thread_from_reply(self, reply_info: Dict[str, Any]) -> Optional[discord.Thread]:
    """
    Create a public thread from reply information.

    Args:
        reply_info: Dictionary containing reply and parent message information

    Returns:
        The created thread, or None if creation failed
    """
    try:
        parent_message = reply_info['parent_message']
        thread_name = Config.get_thread_name(parent_message.content)

        thread = await parent_message.create_thread(
            name=thread_name,
            auto_archive_duration=Config.DEFAULT_AUTO_ARCHIVE_DURATION
        )

        return thread
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Failed to create thread: {e}")
        return None
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Document all parameters and return values
- Explain the purpose and behavior of functions

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

Before submitting a pull request, manually test your changes with a test Discord
server:

1. Ensure the bot runs without errors using `python bot.py`.
2. Verify that replies are converted to threads and that attachments and embeds
   are preserved.
3. Check the console output for warnings or exceptions.

## 📤 Submitting Changes

### Commit Guidelines

1. **Write clear commit messages**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: automatic thread archiving after 7 days"
   git commit -m "fix: handle permission errors gracefully"
   git commit -m "docs: add troubleshooting section for rate limits"
   ```

2. **Keep commits focused**: One logical change per commit
3. **Use present tense**: "add feature" not "added feature"

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - **Clear title** describing the change
   - **Detailed description** of what was changed and why
   - **Reference any related issues** using `#issue-number`
   - **Screenshots** if UI/behavior changes are involved
   - **Testing notes** describing how you tested the changes

## 🚨 Reporting Issues

If you encounter bugs or have feature requests, please open an issue on GitHub.
Include the following details when reporting a problem:

- Steps to reproduce the issue
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened (include console output if possible)
