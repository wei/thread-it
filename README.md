## ✨ Features

- **Automatic Thread Creation**: Converts message replies into organized public threads
- **Clean Channel Management**: Keeps main channels clutter-free by moving discussions to threads
- **Smart Thread Naming**: Automatically generates meaningful thread names from original message content
- **Seamless Operation**: Works in the background without requiring manual commands
- **Content Preservation**: Maintains all reply content including text, attachments, and embeds
- **Permission Validation**: Ensures proper bot permissions before attempting operations
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with graceful fallbacks

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User posts a message** in a Discord channel
2. **Another user replies** to that message
3. **Thread It detects the reply** and automatically:
   - Creates a public thread on the original message
   - Moves the reply content into the new thread
   - Removes the original reply from the main channel
   - Preserves all attachments, embeds, and formatting

The result: Clean main channels with organized discussions in dedicated threads!

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- A Discord bot token
- Discord server with appropriate permissions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wei/thread-it.git
cd thread-it
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application
3. Navigate to the "Bot" section
4. Create a bot and copy the token
5. Enable the following **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
   - Message Content Intent (required)
6. Generate an invite URL with these **permissions**:
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Send Messages in Threads
   - Create Public Threads
   - Manage Messages
   - Read Message History

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your bot token
# DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
# LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Step 6: Run the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

## 📖 Usage

Once installed and running, Thread It works automatically! No commands are needed.

### Example Workflow

```
Main Channel:
👤 Alice: "What's everyone's favorite Python library?"

👤 Bob: "I love requests for HTTP calls!" (replies to Alice's message)
```

**Result**: Thread It automatically creates a thread titled "What's everyone's favorite Python library?" and moves Bob's reply into it.

### Supported Content Types

- ✅ Text messages
- ✅ Images and attachments
- ✅ Embeds
- ✅ Message formatting (bold, italic, code blocks, etc.)
- ✅ Mentions and links (cleaned from thread names)

### Bot Behavior

- **Ignores bot messages**: Prevents infinite loops
- **Only processes replies**: Regular messages are left untouched
- **Skips existing threads**: Won't create threads within threads
- **Validates permissions**: Checks required permissions before acting
- **Sends helpful notifications**: Briefly notifies users where to continue their conversation (auto-deletes after 8 seconds)
- **Handles errors gracefully**: Logs issues without crashing

## 🔐 Required Permissions

Thread It requires specific Discord permissions to function properly. When inviting the bot to your server, ensure these permissions are granted:

| Create Public Threads    | Create threads on messages         |
| Manage Messages          | Delete original reply messages     |
